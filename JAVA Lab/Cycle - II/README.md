2) Write a java program that works as a simple calculator. Use a grid layout to arrange buttons for the digits and for the +, -,*, % operations. Add a text field to display the result. Handle any possible exceptions like divided by zero.

3a) Develop an applet in Java that displays a simple message.

3b) Develop an applet in Java that receives an integer in one text field, and computes its factorial Value and returns it in another text field, when the button named “Compute” is clicked.
4) Write a Java program that creates a user interface to perform integer divisions. The user enters two numbers in the text fields, Num1 and Num2. The division of Num1 and Num 2 is displayed in the Result field when the Divide button is clicked. If Num1 or Num2 were not an integer, the program would throw a Number Format Exception. If Num2 were Zero, the program would throw an Arithmetic Exception. Display the exception in a message dialog box.

5) Write a Java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads. First thread generates random integer every 1 second and if the value is even, second thread computes the square of the number and prints. If the value is odd, the third thread will print the value of cube of the number.
